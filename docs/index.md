#### stable version 0.6.0

Check the [npm repostory](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nem-library) for the latest updates

## Installation

```sh
npm install nem-library --save
```

NEM Library is build with [TypeScript Language][TS-lang], so be sure that you have 
the latest version installed.

We recommend to use TypeScript instead of JavaScript for building applications for 
[NEM Blockchain][NEM-official] due the type  system and how the nem-library is meant 
to be used, without counting other great benefits that TypeScript provides.

```sh
npm install -g typescript
```
