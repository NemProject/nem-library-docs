# About NEM Library

The NEM Library origin is the need of a new development approach for enterprise
ready solutions build on top of [NEM Blockchain][NEM-official].

The characteristics of NEM Library are similar to [NEM Framework][NEM-Framework] definition, but
NEM Library has not the same roadmap or scope as described in NEM Framework document. So, NEM Library future is guided
by the needs of the NEM Library usage and products build on top of it.

NEM Library is developed independently of any institution by [Guillem][GH-Guillem] and [Aleix][GH-Aleix].
