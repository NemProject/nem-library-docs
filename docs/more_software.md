### nem-trezor by shierve

nem-trezor is a typescript / node.js npm module that adds trezor functionalities to nem-library.

For the module to work you will need a trezor device connected to the system and trezor trezor-bridge should be running (or the chrome extension).

The library only works in a browser environment because of the way trezor is implemented, if executed in a node script environment it will throw an exception.
