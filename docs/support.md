## Feature requests

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in NEM Library, 
you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar 
needs. Many of the features that NEM Library has today have been added because 
our users saw the need. Open an [issue](github-issues) on our issues list on GitHub which describes 
the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.
